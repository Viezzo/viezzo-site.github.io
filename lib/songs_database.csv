100 gecs,money machine,F# major,99,"[Verse 1: Laura Les]
Hey, you lil' piss baby
You think you're so fucking cool? Huh?
You think you're so fucking tough?
You talk a lotta big game for someone with such a small truck
Aw, look at those arms
Your arms look so fucking cute
They look like lil' cigarettes
I bet I could smoke you
I could roast you
And then you'd love it and you'd text me ""I love you""
And then I'd fucking ghost you

[Chorus: Laura Les]
With the big boys coming with the big stuff
I feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the picture
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah (oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Laura Les]
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
Tell me what's the deal, I've been tryin' to go to bed
I've been up for days, I've been tryna get ahead
Said it all before, and I'll say it once again
I'm better off alone
Tell me what's the deal, I've been trying to go to bed
I've been up for days, I've been tryna get ahead
Said it all before, and I'll say it once again
I'm better off alone

[Chorus: Laura Les]
With the big boys coming with the big stuff
I feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the picture
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah (oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Laura Les]
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine"

He said, ""I love you,"" on the plane
I said, ""I love you too""
He said, ""Everything is different now, everything has changed
Always on a plane, always something new""
I said, ""Nothing's new, nothing’s changed, I still need you""
I'm 'bout to hit the boof
Smokin’ somethin' new

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
No rules, then I smoke, then it's all gone
Hit that G so hard that I fall off
Taking shots in the dark, that's a bad call
Going straight for your head, gotta saw it off
(Go, go, go, go, go)
I got a bag on the way
(Go, go, go, go, go)
Smokin' a zip in a day
(Go, go, go, go, go)
What were you trying to say?
(Go, go, go, go, go)
Making it up on the way

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
I never say what I need, when I need you
Never say what I need, when I need you
I'm good on the weed but I need you
I might hit the weed, I might hit the boof
I'm addicted to Monster, money, and weed, yeah
I'm blowin’ clouds so loud, you can’t fuckin' see, yeah
I’m addicted to everything that I see, yeah
I'm addicted to making money off me, yeah
I might go and throw my phone into the lake, yeah
It ain't hard to quit caring what you think, yeah
Burnt me one too many times like a tree, yeah
Now there's fire raining down on your screams, yeah

[Outro: Laura Les and Dylan Brady]
Ohhhh
Yeah
(AAAAAAAA)
I hit the big boof then it’s all gone
(AAAAAAAA)
I hit the big boof then it's gone
(AAAAAAAA)
I hit the big boof and the weed, yeah
(AAAAAAAA)
I hit the big boof then it's gone
Just shut the fuck up, where's the weed at?
Just shut the fuck up, where's the weed?
Just please fuck me up, where's the weed at?
Just shut the fuck up"
